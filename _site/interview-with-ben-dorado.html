<h4 id="1-how-did-you-get-your-start-in-design">1. How did you get your start in design?</h4>

<p>I started when I was 16/17 years old to be able to make designs on skates or with friends who made music.</p>

<h4 id="2-what-is-your-daily-routine">2. What is your daily routine?</h4>

<p>I never had a real routine but I understand what I can repeat every day… I walk a lot, and I meditate 3/4 times a week a little more than an hour.</p>

<h4 id="3-what-do-you-consider-before-taking-on-a-new-client">3. What do you consider before taking on a new client?</h4>

<p>Today the most important factors in my opinion are the chemistry between me and the person with whom I will create. I don’t also accept to work for artists but with artists, I am very selective about the people I want to work with, because with time I understood that it was one of the most important elements. I have to work with people who have a real vision and with whom I can learn, share something.</p>

<h4 id="4-can-you-breakdown-your-design-process">4. Can you breakdown your design process?</h4>

<p>It’s quite organic, it’s hard to put words to it on the background, what’s really going on in my head. It’s more realized than thought out like a machine. I know some designers are very methodical, I’m not, let’s say I project what I have to do, I’ll build some directions, some paths to follow, via references or not. Research is a fundamental part and I try to work on it every day, so that I don’t have to do it when I start a project.</p>

<h4 id="5-do-you-have-any-frequent-collaborators-ive-noticed-you-and-pablo-jamaron-do-a-lot-of-work-together">5. Do you have any frequent collaborators. I’ve noticed you and Pablo Jamaron do a lot of work together?</h4>

<p>Indeed, Pablo is really a person that I hold in my heart, it is the person with whom I have a great friendship, a true brotherly love and it is the person with whom I have the best work chemistry.  We are thinking about doing something together. I have great respect for this man, who has helped me a lot and vice versa, we learn from each other with no ego conflict, pure sincerity. This is so rare!
But overall I am a very “collaborative” person, I really choose who I work with but if it works it usually lasts a long time. 
Frequent collaborations are with Oliver El Khatib for example, who I love to work with, he has a real vision, he is an architect. and I have some others that I keep secret ahaha.</p>

<h4 id="6-what-is-your-favourite-logo-one-that-youve-worked-on-yourself-or-one-that-your-really-like">6. What is your favourite logo? One that you’ve worked on yourself or one that your really like?</h4>

<p>It’s too hard for me to have a favorite, so I will choose a logo that has more meaning than aesthetics which is the circle of Zen.</p>

<h4 id="7-do-you-have-a-favorite-sports-logo">7. Do You have a favorite sports logo?</h4>

<p>I am originally from the city of Marseille in the south of France, so OM without hesitation. After that I love all the logos of Todd Radom, the king of sports in the USA.</p>

<h4 id="8-what-is-your-dream-project">8. What is your dream project?</h4>

<p>To be able to build a place where I can teach things, and build something that will be useful for future generations. In what form I have no idea yet.</p>

<h4 id="9-what-advice-would-you-give-to-people-struggling-to-find-freelance-design-work">9. What advice would you give to people struggling to find freelance design work?</h4>

<p>At the beginning, it’s normal to struggle especially if you don’t want to be formatted in an agency or a corporate studio. I didn’t follow this process, and at the beginning it was a roller coaster, but it’s where you learn the most about yourself, about life, about things much wider than what you do, you must never give up, that’s the main advice you have to remember. It is useless for me to give much more, because we all know that as long as we do not experience by ourselves we do not really understand it. And all our roads are different. Preserve your health, don’t give up and stay very open, an infinite openness.</p>

<h4 id="10-do-you-have-any-hobbies-or-interests-outside-of-graphic-design">10. Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of graphic design?</h4>

<p>Besides I read a lot, I’m interested in science a lot, I’m also interested in philosophy and manga, I’m a very big consumer of manga. Do you want to know what I’m reading at the moment? I’m reading a book by Krisnamurti, and in manga I’m on a great classic that I hadn’t read yet, Monster…I finished the last book of Stephen Hawking, very accessible and full of positive energy.</p>
